# simpleAppleScripts
Here's a collection of simple Apple Scripts I've written to help me during the day

* __youaredoingok__: this script runs every hour and tells me I am doing ok. I got the idea for this from Sam Sykes, who suggested we all need a little robot that comes in every hour and tells us we are doing ok and gives us a glass of water.

* __encouragement__: this is an enhancement of *youraredoingok* - it cycles through a list of encouraging things to say

* __logyourmind__: this is another enhancement of *youraredoingok*. It does two things: it either sends you a message of encouragement or it tells you to log something

#### Note:

You can run these scripts from the Script Editor. Or you can enter: _osascript scriptx.scpt_ from a terminal window.
